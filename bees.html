<p> i'm mad at you </p>
<p> i can't leave my apartment without wondering which house is his </p>
<p> i wonder too much about him </p>
<p> it's hard to not think about it </p>
<br>
<p> it's hard to focus my mind recently </p>
<p> whether that's the medication or the illness is hard to discern </p>
<p> it doesn't really matter, either way my head buzzes </p>
<p> a broken tv, flipping through different channels of static </p>
<br>
<p> maybe i'm not wondering about him </p>
<p> maybe i'm wondering about you </p>
<p> really it's a mix of the two, with a large amount of shame thrown in there </p>
<br> 
<p> do i trust you? </p>
<br>
<p> i wonder what would have happened if i didn't eat that edible </p>
<br>
<p> i wonder if i'm going crazy </p>
<br>
<p> i wonder what happened to the person i knew </p>
<p> i don't think she would have done that </p>
<br> 
<p> why the fuck would she let me parade around like john cusack </p>
<p> i don't know that person anymore </p>
<br>
<p>i don't know you at all </p>
