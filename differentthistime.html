<p> i didn't expect you to check </p>
<p> i would've cleaned it up more </p>
<br>
<p> but you checked </p>
<p> and you reached out </p>
<br>
<p> and i realized that there was so much i wanted to talk to you about </p>
<p> so much that i wanted to know about </p>
<p> now more than ever you're always present in my mind </p>
<p>i think of you no matter what i'm doing </p>
<br>
<p> i've come to terms with what happened, i understand my faults and your faults and the mistakes that we both made </p>
<p> i've reached a level of understanding of the past </p>
<p> i am living more in the present </p>
<br>
<p> i thought that your love would save me </p>
<p> i had to save myself first </p>
<p> i rushed you and i had to deal with the results of that </p>
<p> i truly am sorry </p>
<br>
<p> i cannot beg for you back </p>
<p> i know how things can change and how things you said when i visited you at work months ago can no longer be true </p>
<p> i don't think it's my decision to make this time
<p> i heard you had a boyfriend anyway </p>
<br>
<p> there are things i would rather tell you in person, letters i've written that you will probably never read </p>
<p> even most of this feels too personal to just leave in public </p>
<br>
<p> i will just say that i did like that album you sent, especially the song with your name
<p> the concert was good, i saw your sister there </p>
<p> i listen to alice phoebe lou much more now, because it makes me think of you
<p> i save reels on instagram, just in case
<br>
<br>
<p> and i still hold a place for you in my heart 
<p> if you ever want to return to it
<p> maybe it could be <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/different-this-time/1485072464?i=1485072466">different this time </a>
