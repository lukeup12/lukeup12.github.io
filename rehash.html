<p> what else can i do besides wish you well? </p>
<br>
<p> i know that i will see you again, i just don't know if it'll be in person or in my dreams tonight </p>
<p> i'll keep an eye out for that busted headlight </p>
<br>
<p> maybe i'm just delusional </p>
<p> like you were for him </p>
<br> 
<p> something about getting treated like a second option really grabs the brain i suppose </p>
<br>
<p> i don't even know what the fuck i could want from you at this point </p>
<br>
<br>
<p> i just wanted to be loved by you the way i loved you </p>
<p> maybe i was </p>
<p> maybe i've been giving myself too much credit </p>
<p> maybe you're right, and the relationship was doomed since freshman year </p>
<p> maybe i am the person you tell me i am </p>
<br>
<p> maybe i'll never see you again, outside of my dreams </p>
<p> maybe that's for the best </p>
