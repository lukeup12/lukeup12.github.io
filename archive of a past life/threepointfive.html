<p>is it always going to hurt

<p>am i going to see you and hear about you and ache for you for the rest of my life

<p>is that fair?

<p>we werent fair to each other

<p>i know i'll never see you again and i know writing that makes it certain that you will appear somehow

<p>an echo of past love

<p>there's no one else i'd want to love

<p>but holding on to you is making me lose my mind

<p>none of my corner wants us to meet again

<p>i don't know if i'll ever love anyone how i loved you 
<p>all encompassingly

<p>lord knows i have tried

<p>only the lord knows what will be of us 

<p>but the fact that i'm using this site again isn't really a good sign is it?

<p>i don't think you'll ever check

<p> we still have eeyore up at work
<p> i think about you when i see him
<p> i think about you most of the time
<p> all of it really

<br>
<br>
<p> is this it?
