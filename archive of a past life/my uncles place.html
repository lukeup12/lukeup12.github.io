<h2> my uncle's place </h2>
<small> 5/16/23 </small>
<p> the first time i was here, i bought a vinyl record </p>
<p> i texted that huge groupchat about it, and you responded </p>
<p> the start of something beautiful, borne only from chance </p>
<br>
<p> the second time i was here, we argued and argued </p>
<p> i said horrible things to you because of how afraid i was </p>
<p> we made it work for a few months after that </p>
<p> then i got scared, left, and came back again </p>
<br>
<p> now i am here for a third time, and i am afraid i may never hear from you again, at least not in the ways i want to </p>
<p> i have to give you space so you can decide why you want to get back with me; if it's for the right reasons or just because you're lonely </p>
<p> i think being six hours away is a good amount of space, right? </p>
<p> i've been doing okay with not texting you recently </p>
<br>
<p> i hope that if i'm here a fourth time, you'll be with me </p>
<p> i will make you banana pancakes in bed, and we can go wherever you want </p>
<p> i will drink my coffee on the balcony, and i will write </p>
<br>
<p> i will fight for us again, if you let me </p>
