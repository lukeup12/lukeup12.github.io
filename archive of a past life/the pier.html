<h2> the pier </h2>
<small> 4/20/23 </small>
<p> it was a week before we broke up </p>
<p> you wanted to get ice cream from the beach, and i was okay with it </p>
<p> we got our ice cream, and you wanted to see the beach</p>
<p> i complained, but i went with you </p>
<br>
<p> we walked on the pier, and stood over the ocean </p>
<p> the deep, inky darkness scared me deeply, i've always been scared of the ocean </p>
<p> i think i'm just scared of the unknown </p>
<br>
<p> i'm surrounded by that unknown now </p>
<p> it's like i fell into that ocean, and i'm surrounded by that darkness </p>
<p> i'm not quite drowning, but the feeling is the same </p>
