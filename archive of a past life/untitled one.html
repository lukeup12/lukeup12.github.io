<h2> untitled one </h2>
<small> 5/5/23 </small>
<p> so much has happened since i gave you those gummy sharks </p>
<p> i slept over at yours a week later, in a vacuum that would be a great sign </p>
<p> it happened hours after you said we shouldn't see each other this summer </p>
<br>
<p> i know i have to wait but i can't </p>
<p> every fiber of my being yearns to keep pushing, keep asking how i can fix this </p>
<p> i'm impatient and i can't help it, every day that you're not by my side is a waste </p>
<p> every night that i try to sleep without you next to me is impossible </p>
<br>
<p> somehow i keep pushing through the days </p>
<p> at night i dream of us </p>
