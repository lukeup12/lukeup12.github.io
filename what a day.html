<h2> what a day </h2>
<small> 4/22/23</small>
<br>
<h4> 12 am </h4>
<p> i try to go to bed, i have work at 10 </p>
<br>
<h4> 1 am </h4>
<p> i can't sleep </p>
<p> you can't either, and you text me </p>
<p> we talk, i get in my car </p>
<br>
<h4> 2 am </h4>
<p> i get to yours </p>
<p> i give you a hug, and we sit down </p>
<p> i have my arm around you again, and my heart hammers in my chest </p>
<p> we talk about dumb stuff and serious stuff </p>
<p> you say you're considering us </p>
<p> you say we can't right now (fair) </p>
<p> you say i can wait for you </p>
<p> you say i can hate you </p>
<br> 
<p> i could never hate you </p>
<br> 
<p> i go home </p>
<br>
<h4> 3 am </h4> 
<p> i can't sleep </p>
<p> i'm grinning like a fool, despite all the uncertainty </p>
<p> maybe because of the uncertainty </p>
<p> you text me that you enjoyed our convo, that you liked what my mom said </p>
<p> my mom said that whatever's meant to be is meant to be </p>
<p> are we meant to be? </p>
<br>
<h4> 4 am </h4>
<p> finally, sleep </p>
<br>
<h4> 9 am </h4>
<p> i wake up </p>
<p> i get in my car, get dunkin, get to work </p>
<br>
<h4> 10 am </h4>
<p> i'm a giddy idiot at work, i can't stop smiling </p>
<br>
<h4> 2 pm </h4>
<p> the smile hasn't faded </p>
<p> it only intensifies when you text me, asking if i'm going to milly with my roommate </p>
<p> i maybe would've gone, but i had work </p>
<p> i don't think i could've gone if i didn't, it would've sucked being there without you </p>
<p> you say that our conversation was very gilmore girls and i laugh to myself as i throw pinestraw into a pickup truck </p>
<p> you say we could maybe have another conversation tonight </p>
<p> i'd like that </p>
<br>
<h4> 6 pm </h4>
<p> finally off work </p>
<p> i go home and wash off the day, taking more time than usual because i'm covered in dirt, straw, and bits of mulch </p>
<br>
<h4> 9 pm </h4>
<p> i go to target to get dinner (stuffed crust mini pizza, some gatorade) </p>
<p> i pick up those gummy sharks, just in case </p>
<br>
<h4> 11 pm, now </h4>
<p> i write this </p>
<p> as i'm getting my thoughts on paper, you text the groupchat </p>
<p> you've been out with friends and the alcohol reacted a bit with the antibiotics you're on </p>
<p> i text you, selfishly, to tell me if you need anything </p>
<p> i may give you a ride home later </p>
<br>
<p> maybe i'll give you the gummy sharks </p>
<p> maybe we can talk some more </p>
<p> about dumb stuff and serious stuff </p>
