<h2> romcom </h2>
<small> 5/20/23 </small>
<p> this is not a romcom kind of love </p>
<p> this is a bastard child of obsession and desperation </p>
<br>
<p> the opposite of certainty, hanging onto every word you say and every song you post, hoping it means reconciliation </p>
<br> 
<p> fighting the urge to beg you to see me, knowing that it wouldn't fix anything </p>
<br>
<p> the knowledge deep down that i have irrevocably destroyed the most beautiful love i could ever know </p>
<br>
<p> and i'm scared i'll never stop looking for that broken headlight </p>
<br>
<p> i don't know any other way to love than desperately
