<h2> last goodbye </h2>
<small> 9/22/23 </small>
<p> i've given you the last of your things, and with it all my obligation to you </p>
<p> it feels appropriate that i should see you the morning after i cut all ties </p>
<br>
<p> after giving up looking for that broken headlight, of course i would see the broken tailight </p>
<p> the one you got backing into my house the morning after you lied to me, slept with me, and lied to me some more </p>
<br>
<p> i think that this is the last time i will write for you </p>
<p> my therapist told me to write something to never send to you, to say some things i wish i had said when we broke up </p>
<br>
<p> i will, but i will also leave a lot of it here, in case you ever decide to check </p>
<br>
<p> i'm sorry that you didn't feel comfortable telling me anything </p>
<p> i'm sorry that you felt like that was the best option </p>
<p> i'm sorry that you didn't put in more effort until the eleventh hour </p>
<p> i'm sorry that we couldn't make things work </p>
<br>
<p> i would hope you have some regrets, but i sincerely doubt i'll ever get to hear them </p>
<br>
<p> part of my heart will always be with you </p>
<p> i will never be that close to someone again </p>
<br>
<p> if it's meant to be, i'm sure we will see each other again </p>
<p> until then, goodbye </p>
<br>
<p> have a nice life </p>
