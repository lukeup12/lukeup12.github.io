<h2>  grayscale  </h2>
<small> 4/5/23</small>
  <p> i put my phone in grayscale since we split </p>
  <p> it was partly to help me be on it less like i always talked about </p>
  <p> and partly because i've been seeing in grayscale recently</p>
<br>
<p> when i left, i left all the color with you</p>
