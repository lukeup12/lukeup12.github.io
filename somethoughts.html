<p> it's over (again) </p>
<p> how funny that this time we talked about how we always end up back in each others arms </p>
<p> (i don't think that'll happen this time) </p>
<br>
<p> i hate you </p>
<p> i can't hate you </p>
<br>
<p> i remember reading somewhere that hating someone is just another way of loving them </p>
<br>
<p> why'd you only truly apologize to me after telling me how horrible of a person i am? </p>
<p> why'd you wait until i was leaving to put in effort? </p>
<p> why couldn't you have just fucking told me? instead you let me go crazy about not being able to trust you </p>
<br>
<p> i'm sure you're with someone by now </p>
<p> i'm sure you know i am </p>
<p> it doesn't feel right </p>
<br>
<p> did you mean anything you said to me in the last five months? </p>
<p> did you love me in july, sarah? </p>
<br>
<p> i can't stop thinking about how we could have had a life together </p>
<p> i doubt i'll ever feel that way about anyone else </p>
<p> i don't know if you will </p>
<br>
<p> i don't know you at all </p>
<p> i doubt i ever will again </p>
<p> maybe it's for the best </p>
<p> (i don't believe that) </p>
