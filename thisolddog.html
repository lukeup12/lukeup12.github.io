<p> this old dog is ornery and stubborn </p>
<p> he doesn't listen good anymore</p>
<p> he's got patches where they had to take out pieces of him now</p>
<br>
<p> more than anything, he's tired </p>
<p> he sleeps a lot more now </p>
<br>
<p> i give him his medicine each night </p>
<p> he watches me take mine </p>
<p> he follows me around more </p>
<p> when he's not with me, he wanders listlessly </p>
<p> so i keep a closer eye on him </p>
<br>
<p> he watches movies with me </p>
<p> curled up on his bed </p>
<br>
<p> there's some understanding between us </p>
<p> two stubborn, tired dogs </p>
<p> just passing the days together </p>
